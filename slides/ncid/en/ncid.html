<div class="section slide level1" id="representative-government">
<h1>Representative Government</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Primary Power of Government is lawmaking – not voting for politicians</li>
<li>On Election Day voters give their power away to politicians</li>
<li>Result: politician/representatives have a monopoly on lawmaking</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="failure-of-representative-government">
<h1>Failure of Representative Government</h1>
<ul>
<li>Human nature dictates that the self-interest of representatives takes precedence over the interest of the People</li>
<li>As a result representatives fail to address critical issues</li>
<li>Their main concern is to stay in power</li>

<h1>Decision Making Process of Elected Officials</h1>
<ul>
<li>“How will this affect my reelection?”</li>

<div class="section slide level1" id="structure-of-representative-government">
<h1>Structure of Representative Government</h1>
<ul>
<li>Because of human nature, representatives do not put the interest of those they represent above their own</li>

<div class="section slide level1" id="venues-for-change">
<h1>Venues for Change</h1>
<ul>
<li>There are only two venues for political change</li>

<h1>The People as Lawmakers</h1>
<ul>
<li>Lawmaking requires a detailed deliberative process</li>
<li>The U.S. Constitution does not provide procedures for the People to amend the Constitution or make laws</li>

<h1>The Democracy Amendment</h1>
<ul>
<li>asserting the power of People to make laws</li>

<h1>The Democracy Statute</h1>
<ul>
<li>Establishes deliberative legislative procedures</li>
<li>These procedures are similar to those of the Congress and most State Legislatures</li>
<li>The Electoral Trust administers these procedures on behalf of the People</li>
<li>The People’s power to enact the National Initiative is derived from:</li>
<li>The actions of the Founding Generations of Americans</li>
<li>The Declaration of Independence</li>
<li>The Revolutionary War that guaranteed that American Independence</li>
<li>The views of the Founding Fathers</li>

<ul>
<li>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter... it.</li>

<h1>Climate of Compromise in 1787</h1>

<li>Threatening presence of British, Spanish and French on the frontiers</li>

<h1>Constitutional Convention 1787</h1>
<ul>
<li>Goal: create a central federal government to correct the chaotic situation of the Confederate government</li>

<li>The perpetuation of slavery in the Constitution was one of the first moral compromises in American history</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="the-casualty-of-compromise">
<h1>The Casualty of Compromise</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The Framers were informed by the People’s rejection of a Massachusetts constitution in 1778 that perpetuated slavery</p></li>
<li><p>As a result, the Framers sacrificed the principle of the Declaration of Independence and the views of the Founding Fathers that the People, as lawmakers, can directly alter their government</p></li>

<h1>Slavery Force Undemocratic Elements into the Constitution</h1>
<ul>
<li>A slave was 3/5 of a person for calculating representation in the Congress</li>
<li>The Electoral College gives precedence to States rather than to the population of states in calculating votes for presidents</li>
<li>Article V only allows representatives in government to amend the Constitution</li>
<li>Creation of the U.S. Senate voided the democratic effect of the national population</li>
<li>State and local governments control the elections of Federal officials</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="constitutions-undemocratic-adoption">
<h1>Constitution’s Undemocratic Adoption</h1>
<ul>
<li>By using conventions to ratify the Constitution, the Framers excluded the People from the ratification process</li>
<li>As a result, they denied the People their sovereign legislative power to directly create the United States Government.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="effect-of-pushing-the-people-aside">
<h1>Effect of Pushing the People Aside</h1>
<ul>
<li>Representatives gained a monopoly on lawmaking</li>
<li>This monopoly of power led to excesses in government and control by economic elites</li>
<li>This produced unrestricted capitalism and extreme government corruption</li>
<li>This encouraged class conflict and social violence</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="the-progressive-movement">
<h1>The Progressive Movement</h1>
<ul>
<li>At the turn of the century progressives enacted initiative, referendum and recall laws (IRR) at the state level</li>
<li>IRR law have since been enacted in 24 States and more than 200 local communities</li>
<li>Empowering the people as lawmakers at the state level was the most significant development in American governance since the ratification of the Constitution</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="shortcomings-of-irr-laws">
<h1>Shortcomings of IRR Laws</h1>
<ul>
<li>IRR laws lack deliberative and support procedures that exist in all representative legislatures</li>
<li>Representative government controls the IRR process and continually attempts to erode the peoples lawmaking powers</li>
<li>Unlimited corporate money corrupts the IRR process</li>
<li>Citizens cannot legislate independently of their elected representatives</li>

<h1>The People’s Legislative Record</h1>

<li>In spite of inadequate initiative legislative procedures, the people’s record is as good as any legislative body in the United States</li>
<li>With respect to fiscal matters, the People’s record at the state and municipal levels of government is far superior to that of their elected officials because the People know it’s their money</li>

<div class="section slide level1" id="the-obvious-questions">
<h1>The Obvious Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Why can’t the people make laws at the national level as the majority of Americans already do at the state and local levels?</li>
<li>Have Americans forgotten that the Founding Fathers felt that future generations had the right and the obligation to make laws?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="current-obstacles-to-peoples-lawmaking">
<h1>Current Obstacles to People’s Lawmaking</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Congress</strong> does not want to give up its monopoly on legislative power</li>
<li><strong>The Media</strong> serves as the intermediary between the government and the people and does on want to dilute its power either</li>
<li><strong>The People</strong> distrust certain individuals and fear manipulation by small groups because they fail to appreciate that legislative decisions will be made by the majority of the electorate People’s lawmaking requires unreserved faith in the people</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="enacting-the-national-ballot-initiative">
<h1>Enacting the National Ballot Initiative</h1>
<ul>
<li>We, the people, can establish processes to enact the National Ballot Initiative using Article VII as precedent and modern technology, which enables us to ask all Americans if they want to be empowered as lawmakers</li>
<li>The first element process is a national election conducted by a private nonprofit corporation, Philadelphia II, giving Americans the opportunity to vote to enact the National Ballot Initiative</li>
<li>The second element establishes the standard: that the majority of the people who voted in the last presidential election vote affirmatively for the National Ballot Initiative thereby making it the law of the land</li>

<div class="section slide level1" id="the-effect-of-empowering-the-people">
<h1>The Effect of Empowering the People</h1>
<ul>
<li>For the first time in our history, a Government will be created not only Of and For the People, but also <strong>By the People</strong></li>
<li>Eliminating the monopoly of representative government will unleash the awesome power of individual and collective human creativity</li>
<li>It’s time to fully realize the genius and promise of our Founders’ concept of self-government</li>
